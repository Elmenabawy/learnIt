                <p>Egypt, a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest Asia, is known for its rich
                history and cultural heritage. The country is home to some of the world's most iconic landmarks, including the Great
                Pyramids of Giza, the Sphinx, and the ancient temples of Luxor and Karnak. The Nile River, the lifeblood of Egypt, has
                supported civilization for thousands of years, contributing to the development of one of the oldest and most enduring
                civilizations in human history. Today, Egypt is a vibrant nation with a diverse economy, driven by tourism, agriculture,
                and a growing technology sector. Its strategic location as a gateway between Africa, Europe, and Asia has made it a key
